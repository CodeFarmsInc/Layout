      Program Layout which generates the UML class diagram
      ----------------------------------------------------

    layout.exe reads file layout.inp which is a byproduct automatically
    produced by the code generator of Code Farms libraries,
    You can also easily code it by hand - either for testing or 
    when using other libraries such STL.

    If you use Data Object Library (DOL) , each call to zzprep.exe 
    automatically creates layout.inp.

    If you use InCode  Library, the following call to codegen.exe
    creates login.inp:

    codegen -uml [-dol] dsFile libPath genFile srcList umlID ... also UML diagr
       where:
         static  uses static functions as interface (recommended),
         dol     uses the old DOL interface (for historical comparison)

         dsFile  input file which contains all the DataStructure statements
            used by the program(typically ds.def),
         libPath is the relative or absolute path to the library directory,
            the library must contain the 'registry' file.
         genFile name of the file that will be generated.
         umlID   unique ID for all the UML objects in this project
         srcList is an optional list such as produced by "dir *.h" under DOS
            or "ls *.h" under UNIX. When this list is not given, the generator
            does not generate inheritance records.

    A call to layout.exe creates two files: the diagram as a svg file and file 
    layout.log which is the input for the JavaDisplay program.
 
    JavaDisplay.java (in directory javadisp) produces a window with
      the UML diagram.

    For examples of diagrams produced with this program, click
    on any file out*.svg or jav*.bat in subdirectory test\results.


Calling syntax of the Layout program itself:
--------------------------------------------
    layout -s paramFile [inpFile outFile]
         paramFile describes screen parameters, usually param.txt,
         inpFile - file layout.inp produced by alib or jlib code generator,
         outFile - the name of the svg file.

    java JavaDisplay inpFile
        where inpFile is usually file display.log generated by layout.cpp

The two displays are identical, but may differ in speed and in viewing 
utilities such as zoom or print, depending on what additional tools you are
using.

File param.txt describes the parameters of your screen - its dimension and
the font sizes to be used in the UML diagram. This file can be either manually
typed in, or generated by program GenParamFile. 

Subdirectories:
    doc - documentation
    src - source of the Layout program
    bin - binary of the Layout program
    test - collection of tests and examples
    javadisp - JavaDisplay program
    tmp - automatically created expansion of InCode templates
    incode - InCode data structure library with which this is coded

WARNING: An older version of the InCode library must be used at least for 
    now. When compiled with the most recent version of InCode, program
    Layout crashes . This is a serious problem we have to address.
